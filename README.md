# Tree or me?

This was an idea for a christmas card project, but is also a useful lesson in machine learning for image recongition.

Here we build a machine learning model which will be able to distinguish pictures of people in the group from pictures of their christmas trees.  Not the toughest image recognition task in the world, but it's the thought that counts :-)

The AI model is build using keras.
